            <p>The Pyramids of Giza, located on the west bank of the Nile River near Al-Jizah in northern Egypt, 
                are a marvel of ancient engineering and cultural significance. These monumental tombs were built around
                 4,500 years ago during the 4th dynasty. The largest and oldest of these is the Great Pyramid, 
                 built by Pharaoh Khufu. This pyramid, initially standing at 146.6 metres, 
                 was the world's tallest human-made structure for more than 3,800 years. 
                 The Great Pyramid is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. 
                 The pyramid complex also includes two mortuary temples, tombs for Khufu's immediate family and court, 
                 three smaller pyramids for Khufu's wives, an even smaller "satellite pyramid", and five buried solar barges.
            </p>
            <p>The Red Pyramid, also known as the North Pyramid, is the largest of the pyramids located at the Dahshur necropolis in Cairo, 
                Egypt. It is named for the rusty reddish hue of its red limestone stones. Interestingly, it was not always red. 
                It used to be cased with white Tura limestone, but only a few of these stones now remain at the pyramid's base. 
                During the Middle Ages, much of the white Tura limestone was taken for buildings in Cairo, revealing the red limestone 
                beneath. The Red Pyramid is the third-largest Egyptian pyramid, after those of Khufu and Khafre at Giza. 
                It was one of three pyramids built by King Sneferu, and it may have been started in the 13th year of his reign, 
                taking 10 years to be built. The pyramid is believed to be Egypt's first successful attempt at constructing 
                a "true" smooth-sided pyramid.</p>

            <p>The Pyramid of Djoser, sometimes referred to as the Step Pyramid, is an archaeological marvel located 
                in the Saqqara necropolis, Egypt. Constructed around 2670-2650 BC during the Third Dynasty for the burial 
                of Pharaoh Djoser, it is the earliest colossal stone building in Egypt. The pyramid was designed by Imhotep, 
                the chancellor of the pharaoh and high priest of the god Ra. The pyramid originally stood 62.5 meters tall, 
                with a base of 109 m x 121 m, and was clad in polished white limestone. It is a 6-tier, 4-sided structure 
                and is considered the earliest large-scale cut stone construction. The pyramid is the central feature of a 
                vast mortuary complex in an enormous courtyard surrounded by ceremonial structures and decoration.
